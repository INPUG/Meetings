# Talk Sparknotes

This talk presented various ways that you can leverage toast notifications in your environments.
We touched on Engine Events, Alerts, Reminders, cross platform and pure .Net use cases.

The demo scripts are available individually in the Scripts folder for you to easily grab and run with any of the content that was demonstrated during the talk.
